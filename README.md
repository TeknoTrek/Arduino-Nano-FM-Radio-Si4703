# FM Radio Project with Arduino Nano and Si4703

This project is an FM radio built using the Arduino Nano, Si4703 FM module, PAM8403 stereo amplifier module, rotary encoder, and a 16x02 LCD display. It is designed to tune FM frequencies and provide stereo audio output through speakers.

## Project Components

- **Arduino Nano**: Used as the microcontroller.
- **Si4703 FM Radio Module**: Receives FM radio signals.
- **PAM8403 Stereo Amplifier Module**: Amplifies the audio output.
- **Rotary Encoder**: Used for tuning the frequency and adjusting the volume.
- **16x02 LCD Display**: Displays the current FM frequency.

## Project Files

This repository includes the following files:

- **Schematic**: Circuit schematic created using KiCad.
- **PCB Design**: Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design made with KiCad.
- **3D Models**: 3D models of the components used in the project.
- **Code**: Arduino code to control the FM radio module and display frequencies on the LCD.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:
- Arduino IDE (version 1.8.2 or newer)
- Si4703 Arduino library
- KiCad (for viewing the schematic and PCB design)

## Installation

1. **Install Arduino IDE** and add the Si4703 library.
2. Upload the `.ino` file from this repository to the Arduino Nano.
3. Connect the components as per the circuit schematic.
4. Power the device, and use the rotary encoder to tune the radio frequency.
